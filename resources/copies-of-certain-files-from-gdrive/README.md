# Copies of Google Drive files needed for work being done in this repository

This is probably dumb, but I'm putting copies in a subdirectory structure mirroring that
of the GDrive files.

I'll also list here which files are actually copied and when. And I'll make a symlink to each in this directory.

| Copy date  | File path                                                                                                                                                         | Link                                                                         | Source           |
