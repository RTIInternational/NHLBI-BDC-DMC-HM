BodySite A site in the body of an organism, typically described in terms of an anatomical concept and optional qualifiers (e.g. left/right, upper/lower). But body sites as defined here may include non-canonical sites, such as an implanted medical device. CauseOfDeath A class / complex datatype for handling both values and ordinality for causes of death. Condition Conditions are records of a Person suggesting the presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign or a symptom, which is either observed by a Provider or reported by the patient. Conditions are recorded in different sources and levels of standardization. Consent An entity that can be used to capture consent code and other relevant data about consent for a study. Demography Demographics about an individual or animal receiving care or other health-related services. Document A collection of information intented to be understood together as a whole, and codified in human-readable form. Exposure Exposures are records of a Person suggesting exposure to a medication, device, environmental material. DeviceExposure DeviceExposures are records of a Person suggesting exposure to a foreign object. The source is typically physical objects used in procedures, measurements, or observations. DrugExposure DrugExposures are records of a Person suggesting exposure to a medication. The source could be prescription, dispensing, medication administration records (MARs), or patient medication list. File Abstract class for various kinds of files. Subclasses may be defined for specific file types. Observation A data structure with key (observation_type) and value (value) attributes that represents a single observation, such as the hematocrit component of a complete blood count panel. DimensionalObservation A structured object that describes a single data item about the physical dimensions of an entity (e.g. length width, area), as generated through a point-in-time observation or measurement. MeasurementObservation A data structure with key (observation_type) and value (value) attributes that represents a single observation, such as the hematocrit component of a complete blood count panel. SdohObservation A data structure with key (observation_type) and value (value) attributes that represents a single observation, such as the hematocrit component of a complete blood count panel. SpecimenQualityObservation A structured object that describes a characteristic of a specimen indicative of its quality or suitability for use, as generated through a point-in-time observation or measurement. SpecimenQuantityObservation A structured object that describes a single data item about the quantity of a Specimen, as generated through a point-in-time observation or measurement. ObservationSet A structured object to hold related Observations in a set. DimensionalObservationSet A set of one or more discrete observations about the physical dimensions of an object (e.g. length, width, area). MeasurementObservationSet A structured object to hold related Observations in a set. SdohObservationSet A structured object to hold related Observations in a set. Organization A grouping of people or organizations with a common purpose such as a data coordinating center, an university, or an institute within a university. Participant A Participant is the entity of interest in a research study, typically a human being or an animal, but can also be a device, group of humans or animals, or a tissue sample. Human research subjects are usually not traceable to a particular person to protect the subject\u2019s privacy. Person Administrative information about an individual or animal receiving care or other health-related services. Procedure Procedure contains records of activities or processes ordered by, or carried out by, a healthcare provider on the patient to have a diagnostic or therapeutic purpose. Procedures are present in various data sources in different forms with varying levels of standardization. [Derived from OMOP] Quantity A structured object to represent an amount of something (e.g., weight, mass, length, duration of time) - including a value and unit. Questionnaire A Questionnaire is an organized collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, providers or other individuals involved in the healthcare domain. They may be simple flat lists of questions or can be hierarchically organized in groups and sub-groups, each containing questions. The Questionnaire defines the questions to be asked, how they are ordered and grouped, any intervening instructional text and what the constraints are on the allowed answers. The results of a Questionnaire can be communicated using the QuestionnaireResponse. (FHIR) QuestionnaireItem QuestionnaireItem defines a question or section within the Questionnaire QuestionnaireResponse QuestionnaireResponse provides a complete or partial list of answers to a set of questions filled when responding to a questionnaire. (FHIR) ResearchStudy A process where a researcher or organization plans and then executes a series of steps intended to increase the field of healthcare-related knowledge. This includes studies of safety, efficacy, comparative effectiveness and other information about medications, devices, therapies and other interventional and investigative techniques. A ResearchStudy involves the gathering of information about human or animal subjects. Specimen Any material taken as a sample from a biological entity (living or dead), or from a physical object or the environment. Specimens are usually collected as an example of their kind, often for use in some investigation. SpecimenContainer A vessel in which a specimen is held or to which it is attached - for storage or as a substrate for growth (e.g. a cell culture dish) or analysis (e.g. a microscope slide or 96-well plate) SpecimenCreationActivity The process of creating a specimen. This may occur through observing and/or collecting material from an biological source or natural setting, or through derivation from an existing specimen (e.g. via portioning or aliquoting). SpecimenProcessingActivity An activity that modifies the physical structure, composition, or state of a specimen. Unlike SpecimenCreation, SpecimenProcessing activities do not result in the generation of new entities - they take a single specimen as input, and output that same specimen. SpecimenStorageActivity An activity in which a specimen is stored or maintained in a particular location, container, or state. Unlike 'processing' activities, storage does not alter the \\nintrinsic physical nature of a specimen. SpecimenTransportActivity An activity through which a specimen is transported between locations or organizations. Substance A type of material substance, or instance thereof, as used in a particular application. May include information about the role the substance played in a particular application. TimePoint A structured representation of a single point in time that allows direct/explicit declaration as a dateTime, specification in terms of offset from a defined index, or description of an event type as a proxy for the time point when it occurred. Visit Events where Persons engage with the healthcare system for a duration of time. They are often also called \u201cEncounters\u201d. Visits are defined by a configuration of circumstances under which they occur, such as (i) whether the patient comes to a healthcare institution, the other way around, or the interaction is remote, (ii) whether and what kind of trained medical staff is delivering the service during the Visit, and (iii) whether the Visit is transient or for a longer period involving a stay in bed. (OMOP) QuestionnaireResponseItem QuestionnaireResponseItem provides a complete or partial list of answers to a set of questions filled when responding to a questionnaire. (FHIR) QuestionnaireResponseValue Single-valued answer to the question. (FHIR) QuestionnaireResponseValueBoolean Single-valued boolean answer to the question QuestionnaireResponseValueDecimal Single-valued decimal answer to the question QuestionnaireResponseValueInteger Single-valued integer answer to the question QuestionnaireResponseValueString Single-valued string answer to the question QuestionnaireResponseValueTimePoint Single-valued TimePoint answer to the question ResearchStudyCollection A holder for ResearchStudy objects TimePeriod A period of time between a start and end time point."},{"location":"#slots","title":"Slots","text":"Slot Description
