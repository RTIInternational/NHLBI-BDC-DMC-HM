BodySite A site in the body of an organism, typically described in terms of an anatomical concept and optional qualifiers (e.g. left/right, upper/lower). But body sites as defined here may include non-canonical sites, such as an implanted medical device. Condition Conditions are records of a Person suggesting the presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign or a symptom, which is either observed by a Provider or reported by the patient. Conditions are recorded in different sources and levels of standardization. Consent An entity that can be used to capture consent code and other relevant data about consent for a study. Demography Demographics about an individual or animal receiving care or other health-related services. DeviceExposure DeviceExposures are records of a Person suggesting exposure to a foreign object. The source is typically physical objects used in procedures, measurements, or observations. Document A collection of information intented to be understood together as a whole, and codified in human-readable form. DrugExposure DrugExposures are records of a Person suggesting exposure to a medication. The source could be prescription, dispensing, medication administration records (MARs), or patient medication list. File Abstract class for various kinds of files. Subclasses will be defined for specific file types. Observation A data structure with key (observation_type) and value (value) attributes that represents a single observation, such as the hematocrit component of a complete blood count panel. DimensionalObservation A structured object that describes a single data item about the physical dimensions of an entity (e.g. length width, area), as generated through a point-in-time observation or measurement. SpecimenQualityObservation A structured object that describes a characteristic of a specimen indicative of its quality or suitability for use, as generated through a point-in-time observation or measurement. SpecimenQuantityObservation A structured object that describes a single data item about the quantity of a Specimen, as generated through a point-in-time observation or measurement. ObservationSet A structured object to hold related Observations in a set. DimensionalObservationSet A set of one or more discrete observations about the physical dimensions of an object (e.g. length, width, area). Organization A grouping of people or organizations with a common purpose such as a data coordinating center, an university, or an institute within a university. Participant A Participant is the entity of interest in a research study, typically a human being or an animal, but can also be a device, group of humans or animals, or a tissue sample. Human research subjects are usually not traceable to a particular person to protect the subject\u2019s privacy. Person Administrative information about an individual or animal receiving care or other health-related services. Quantity A structured object to represent an amount of something (e.g., weight, mass, length, duration of time) - including a value and unit. Questionnaire A Questionnaire is an organized collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, providers or other individuals involved in the healthcare domain. They may be simple flat lists of questions or can be hierarchically organized in groups and sub-groups, each containing questions. The Questionnaire defines the questions to be asked, how they are ordered and grouped, any intervening instructional text and what the constraints are on the allowed answers. The results of a Questionnaire can be communicated using the QuestionnaireResponse. (FHIR) QuestionnaireItem QuestionnaireItem defines a question or section within the Questionnaire QuestionnaireResponse QuestionnaireResponse provides a complete or partial list of answers to a set of questions filled when responding to a questionnaire. (FHIR) ResearchStudy A process where a researcher or organization plans and then executes a series of steps intended to increase the field of healthcare-related knowledge. This includes studies of safety, efficacy, comparative effectiveness and other information about medications, devices, therapies and other interventional and investigative techniques. A ResearchStudy involves the gathering of information about human or animal subjects. Specimen Any material taken as a sample from a biological entity (living or dead), or from a physical object or the environment. Specimens are usually collected as an example of their kind, often for use in some investigation. SpecimenContainer A vessel in which a specimen is held or to which it is attached - for storage or as a substrate for growth (e.g. a cell culture dish) or analysis (e.g. a microscope slide or 96-well plate) SpecimenCreationActivity The process of creating a specimen. This may occur through observing and/or collecting material from an biological source or natural setting, or through derivation from an existing specimen (e.g. via portioning or aliquoting). SpecimenProcessingActivity An activity that modifies the physical structure, composition, or state of a specimen. Unlike SpecimenCreation, SpecimenProcessing activities do not result in the generation of new entities - they take a single specimen as input, and output that same specimen. SpecimenStorageActivity An activity in which a specimen is stored or maintained in a particular location, container, or state. Unlike 'processing' activities, storage does not alter the \\nintrinsic physical nature of a specimen. SpecimenTransportActivity An activity through which a specimen is transported between locations or organizations. Substance A type of material substance, or instance thereof, as used in a particular application. May include information about the role the substance played in a particular application. TimePoint A structured representation of a single point in time that allows direct/explicit declaration as a dateTime, specification in terms of offset from a defined index, or description of an event type as a proxy for the time point when it occurred. Visit Events where Persons engage with the healthcare system for a duration of time. They are often also called \u201cEncounters\u201d. Visits are defined by a configuration of circumstances under which they occur, such as (i) whether the patient comes to a healthcare institution, the other way around, or the interaction is remote, (ii) whether and what kind of trained medical staff is delivering the service during the Visit, and (iii) whether the Visit is transient or for a longer period involving a stay in bed.

The \"id\" field is more likely to be a serially or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is created in a system. from_schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm rank: 1000 slot_uri: schema:identifier identifier: true alias: id owner: ResearchStudy domain_of: - Entity range: uriorcurie required: true","title":"Induced"},{"location":"ResearchStudyCollection/","text":"Class: ResearchStudyCollection A holder for ResearchStudy objects URI: bdchm:ResearchStudyCollection classDiagram class ResearchStudyCollection ResearchStudyCollection : entries ResearchStudyCollection --> ResearchStudy : entries Slots Name Cardinality and Range Description Inheritance entries 0..* ResearchStudy direct Identifier and Mapping Information Schema Source from schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm Mappings Mapping Type Mapped Value self bdchm:ResearchStudyCollection native bdchm:ResearchStudyCollection LinkML Source Direct name: ResearchStudyCollection description: A holder for ResearchStudy objects from_schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm attributes: entries: name: entries from_schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm rank: 1000 multivalued: true range: ResearchStudy inlined: true tree_root: true Induced name: ResearchStudyCollection description: A holder for ResearchStudy objects from_schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm attributes: entries: name: entries from_schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm rank: 1000 multivalued: true alias: entries owner: ResearchStudyCollection domain_of: - ResearchStudyCollection range: ResearchStudy inlined: true tree_root: true","title":"Class: ResearchStudyCollection"},{"location":"ResearchStudyCollection/#class-researchstudycollection","text":"A holder for ResearchStudy objects URI: bdchm:ResearchStudyCollection classDiagram class ResearchStudyCollection ResearchStudyCollection : entries ResearchStudyCollection --> ResearchStudy : entries","title":"Class: ResearchStudyCollection"},{"location":"ResearchStudyCollection/#slots","text":"Name Cardinality and Range Description Inheritance entries 0..* ResearchStudy direct","title":"Slots"},{"location":"ResearchStudyCollection/#identifier-and-mapping-information","text":"","title":"Identifier and Mapping Information"},{"location":"ResearchStudyCollection/#schema-source","text":"from schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm","title":"Schema Source"},{"location":"ResearchStudyCollection/#mappings","text":"Mapping Type Mapped Value self bdchm:ResearchStudyCollection native bdchm:ResearchStudyCollection","title":"Mappings"},{"location":"ResearchStudyCollection/#linkml-source","text":"","title":"LinkML Source"},{"location":"ResearchStudyCollection/#direct","text":"name: ResearchStudyCollection description: A holder for ResearchStudy objects from_schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm attributes: entries: name: entries from_schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm rank: 1000 multivalued: true range: ResearchStudy inlined: true tree_root: true","title":"Direct"},{"location":"ResearchStudyCollection/#induced","text":"name: ResearchStudyCollection description: A holder for ResearchStudy objects from_schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm attributes: entries: name: entries from_schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm rank: 1000 multivalued: true alias: entries owner: ResearchStudyCollection domain_of: - ResearchStudyCollection range: ResearchStudy inlined: true tree_root: true","title":"Induced"},{"location":"SectionLocationEnum/","text":"Enum: SectionLocationEnum The location in a parent specimen from which a section/portion was excised.

Also, since these identifiers are created outside the information system through a specific business process, the Identifier type has additional attributes to capture this additional metadata so the actual identifier values are qualified by the context that created those values. This additional context allows \"identifier\" instances to be transmitted as business data across systems while still being able to trace them back to the system of origin. from_schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm rank: 1000 slot_uri: schema:identifier multivalued: true alias: identity owner: Specimen domain_of: - Person - Demography - Participant - ResearchStudy - Organization - Questionnaire - QuestionnaireItem - Condition - DrugExposure - DeviceExposure - Document - Specimen - BiologicProduct range: Identifier id: name: id description: The 'logical' identifier of the entity within the system of record. The simple value of this attribute stands for an identifier of this data object within the system, it can be used as a reference from other objects within the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique per type of object. The same data object copied to a different system will likely have a different \"id\" in the new system since \"id\" values are system specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured in the \"identifier\" field. The \"id\" field is more likely to be a serially or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is created in a system. from_schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm rank:
